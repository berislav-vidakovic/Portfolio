The data source is a Page on Wikipedia where there is a table with top 30 largest German companies, ranked in the Fortune Global 500 list as well. The data will be loaded using Web Scraping method and after loading data will be analyzed to obtain useful insights.

As Data Analyst searching for a job in Germany, I am interested in some details of top German companies. There are information available on Wikipedia Page, but I need some useful insights such as the most profitable industries, the most successful companies by profit per employee or the cities with more company headquarters. I would like to have these insight vizualized, but on Wikipedia there is only a table and some text, so I need a technique to obtain the Wiki table into data model that is able to be processed.
