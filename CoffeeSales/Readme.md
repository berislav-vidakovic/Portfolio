The goal of this project is to analyze the Coffee Sales dataset and derive valuable insights about the sales of different types of coffee to different destinations and find what types of coffee are more popular than others. 

There is Dashboard to be built out of available Data, to be able to get insights i.e. answers to particular business questions, as well to enable a flexibility and opportunity to answer more possible future questions using interactive Dashboard's user interface.
